<a href="https://0xcc.sh/">0xCC - 5th - 6th May</a></b> | Attended

Note: 0xcc is a free cyber security training conference by women, for women. This year, 150 women registered for the con! More info can be found here.
I took the Hacktastic Voyage: Explore Web App Hacking Fundamentals class and learned quite a bit. There were around 25 of us in the class.

Things taught in the class:

    XSS
    SQL injection
    JWT
    CSRF
    SSRF
    Broken Access Control
    Authentication/Authorization
    Tokens and Session Management
    And more...

During break times at the conference, I tried lockpicking at the lockpicking village. After my experience with lockpicking at the con, I very much wish to join a locksport club soon but not now. Lockpicking is such a great hobby for pentesters!

At the end of the second day, we all (those in the web class) did a ctf that was created by our two intructors (Mel and Renae). The challenges were very fun and I happily came third and got a prize of 1 year Hack The Box subscription :) 
            It was a great event where I met a lot of like-minded people.

Overall, it was two great wonderful days! Will hopefully attend again next year!

            
<a href="https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/">MozFest - 20th - 24th March</a> | Attended

Couldn't attend many sessions due to timezones but overall I learned heaps on new Mozilla products, particularly hubs (: 
It was so great to meet folks from around the world in real-time!
