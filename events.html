<b>2023:</b>
<li><b><a href="https://0xcc.sh/">0xCC - 5th - 6th May</a></b></b></li>
    <p>Note: 0xcc is a free cyber security training conference by women, for women. This year, 150 women registered for the con! More info can be found here.
I took the Hacktastic Voyage: Explore Web App Hacking Fundamentals class and learned quite a bit. There were around 25 of us in the class.

Things taught in the class:

    XSS,
    SQL injection,
    JWT,
    CSRF,
    SSRF,
    Broken Access Control,
    Authentication/Authorization,
    Tokens and Session Management,
    And more...

During break times at the conference, I tried lockpicking at the lockpicking village. After my experience with lockpicking at the con, I very much wish to join a locksport club soon but not now. Lockpicking is such a great hobby for pentesters!

At the end of the second day, we all (those in the web class) did a ctf that was created by our two intructors (Mel and Renae). The challenges were very fun and I happily came third and got a prize of 1 year Hack The Box subscription :) 
            It was a great event where I met a lot of like-minded people.

Overall, it was two great wonderful days! Will hopefully attend again next year!</p>

    
<li><b><a href="https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/">MozFest - 20th - 24th March</a></b></li>
    <p>I had my volunteer shift from 8am - 10:30am (AEST) for MozFest! It was a wonderful experience seeing the various sessions at the time and meeting folks all over the world.

For those who volunteer, you have the responsibility to give technical support for MozFest participants through Slack, SpatialChat, and Mozilla Hubs. It's like a mix of event management, support, and moderating work.

Overall, a wonderful learning experience that I wish to do again next year!

Couldn't attend many sessions due to timezones and volunteering but overall I learned heaps on new Mozilla products, particularly hubs (: 
It was so great to meet folks from around the world in real-time!</p>
