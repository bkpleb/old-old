I am currently a Social Support Moderator and SUMO contributor and KB writer for Mozilla. I love to contribute to open source and helping make the internet better!

<b><i>Work Experience:</i></b>

Social Support Moderator at Mozilla (Aug 2022 - Current)

SUMO & KB contributor at Mozilla (Aug 2021 - Current)

<b><i>Community Volunteering Experience:</i></b>

Group leader for Crossway Prep to Grade 6 Weekend Services at Crossway Baptist Church (2020 - 2021)

<b>What do I do specifically?</b>

First what is Social Support? Well a brief overview would be volunteers and staff supports Firefox users through social networks, mainly on Twitter. More about Social Support can be found here. 
As a Social Support moderator, I use Conversocial (provider of social customer service software) to do the work.

As a Social Support Moderator, I do the following: 
    (1) coordinate hand-offs or escalations when necessary
    (2) moderate behaviour of both Mozilla product users and other Social Support volunteers
    (3) drive volunteers motivation to particpate, and (4) help make decisions and consider ideas for improvement.

As a SUMO contributor, I answer support questions at Mozilla Support. It is extremely similar to technical support or customer support.

As a KB contributor, I contribute to editing and creating Mozilla's knowledge base articles. My edits and creations can be seen here.
