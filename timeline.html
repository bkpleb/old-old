<p>Here is a small timeline of my "tech journey" in a way.</p>

  
</form></div>
<table class="index"><tr><td valign="top"><table class="index">
<tr><td> <ul>
<li><b>2015:</b> I got a Lego Mindstorms EV3 (home edition) that year and it introduced me to programming. </li>
<li><b>2016 - 2018:</b> Did various EV3 related projects at my school's robotics program. </li>
<li><b>2020:</b> Attended my first infosec conference focused on dronsec. Did my first ctf. </li>
<li><b>2020 - 2021:</b> Competitive programming frenzy period. Was extremely active on <a href="https://open.kattis.com/users/vintagemind">Kattis</a>, didn't give a damn of Codeforces & Leetcode. Did olympiads during this timeframe. </li>
<li><b>2021 - present:</b> Contributing to Mozilla as an <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/user/VintageMind/">NDA'd SUMO contributor, KB writer, and Social Support Moderator</a>.</li>
<li><b>2022 - present:</b> Casually do ctfs, learn infosec, don't let computer bugs bite. </li>
<li><b>2023: </b> Got started with the lightning network and node experiments. As well as learning Solidity to get started with smart contract ctfs, etc.</li>
  


As you can see, I live an extremely normal life. No prodigy hacker at the age of 17, no big brains, and no smart-ass results. Everyone has different circumstances and situations, just make best use of your own.
