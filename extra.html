<b><i>Fencing</i></b>

I have been fencing since I was 10 years old and I am a professional foilist (though I can fence sabre). 
My biggest achievements so far would be getting two national medals in the 2020 Australian National Junior (U20) Championships. 
I achieved silver medal in Womens' Sabre Team and bronze medal in Womens' Foil Team. I have won numerous individual Victorian state and 
state championship medals in foil U15, U17, U20 age groups over the years. 
Planning to do international competitions from start of 2025 (hopefully).

<b><i>Ballet</i></b>

I've started ballet in late 2022 at a ballet academy. Ballet personally has become a rehab program but I do wish to progress all the way to p
ointe and as of now I am on ballet shoes/slippers. Progressing to demi-pointe next year would be a great achievement!

<b><i>Bird Watching and Ornithology</i></b>

I have taken a liking towards bird watching from the start of 2021. I have been doing it everyday ever since. 
Currently, all my bird watching observations and spotting spots can be found on eBird, a project by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Audubon. 
It all started with birds flocking to my backyard and I observed the various behaviors. Behaviors from how they forage for food, keeping pecking 
the glass windows, grooming, callings, etc. Hopefully sometime in the future, I can join an ornithological society. Also, check out my Youtube channel, 
I have some recording of birds which come to my backyard very often.

<b><i>Track and Field & Cross-Country</i></b>

In 2018 and 2019, I managed to get into the EMR finals (above divisions and below state) for both track and field (800m and 1500m) and cross-country (3km). 
All the events, districts, divisions, and regions competitions I have participated were hosted by Sports School Victoria (SSV). In cross-country events, 
in order to be qualified for the next level competition, you must be top 10 in districts, divisions, and regional competitions. In track and field, 
in order to be qualified for the next level competition, you must place first or second. In cross-country, I have consistently been placed top 5 
(occasional second and third place). In track and field events, I have consistently been placed second (except for one first place in
800m).
