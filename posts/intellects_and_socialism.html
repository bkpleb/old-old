<h3 align="left">The Intellectuals and Socialism By F.A. Hayek: </h3>

<p> Based on my readings so far, having finished reading this book, I want to highlight a few points that I believe are very important. Do note, the following statements are written down in the book itself. 
I am merely pointing them out (no copyright intended).</p>
  
<p> 1. "A strong belief prevails that the influence of the itellectuals on politics is negligible." (Page 371)</p>
  
<p> 2. "In every country that has moved toward socialism, the phase of the development in which socialism becomes a determining influence on politics has been preceded for many years by a period during 
    which socialist ideals governed the thinking of the more active intellectuals." (Page 371) </p>
  
<p> 3. "The all-persuasive influence of the intellectuals in contemporary society is still furthered strengthned by the growing important of "organization"." (Page 373) </p>
  
<p> 4. "Intellectuals are the organs which modern society has developed for spreading knowledge and ideas..." (Page 374)</p>
  
<p> 5. "The whole the typical intellectual today is more likely to be socialist the more he his guided by good will and intelligence..." (Page 375)</p>
  
<p> 6. "...once freedom has been achieved it is taken for granted and ceases to be valued, and that the free growth of ideas which is the essence of a free society will bring about 
    the destruction of the foundations on which it depends." (Page 383) </p>
  
<p> 7. "The main lesson which the true liberal must learn from the success of the socialists is that it was their courage to be Utopian which gained them the support of the intellectuals and therefore 
    an influence on public opinion which is daily making possible what only recently seemed utterly remote." (Page 384) </p>
  
<p> Hayek's main concern was whether the intellectual revival of liberalism (even though is already underway in many parts of the world) will be in time possible before the next crisis. 
We have to take into consideration that all this was first written/open to the public in 1949 and we all know how times have dramatically changed since then. Most of the theories mentioned by classical economists can't be applied today for numerous reasons 
but I strongly believe that the fundamental principles can never change. </p>
