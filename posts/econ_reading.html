<p> As someone who loves physical copies of books, I detest e-books. But sometimes you can't help it.</p>
<p> I highly recommend to anyone interested in learning more on libertarian thoughts and anaylsis, read the aviable volumes of numerous works at <a href="https://mises.org/archives/the-journal-of-libertarian-studies">The Journal of Libertarian Studies</a> provided by the Mises Institute. </p>
